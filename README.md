# Duelists — Unity C#

**Status:** archived

**Maintenance:** I will not return to this project; no further changes will be made.

## Overview

Duelists is a Unity player-versus-AI game I created in 2025. 

I developed this pretty quickly to publish a game idea on itch.io, so the code and the assets are not the greatest and I've abandonded it unpolished.

## Game Overview:

This is a 2D fighting game, which requires precision and good reaction time. You fight a bot in a 1v1 sword duel. You can attack or block/parry in 3 directions: Overhead, middle, low. You lose all 10 hearts and it's game over.

## What I learned

- Learned more about C# and Unity.
- Implementing a more modular/reusable system.
